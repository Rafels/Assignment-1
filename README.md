# Assignment-1 - readme
This is an assignment for my C++ class at the University College of Oslo and Akershus.
The assignement is a basic introduction to c and c++, consisting of 10 different exercises. 
The exercises vary from simple integer sorting to more complex mathematical problems, and promts the programmer to use different
functions like for-loops, while-loops, if-else statements and basic referencing.
This document is only my proposed solution and is not in any way a definitive solution to the exercices in the assignment.

Those who wish to copy or borrow from my code are welcome to do so.
